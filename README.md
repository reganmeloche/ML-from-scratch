# ML-from-scratch
Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch

This is a repository that contains notebooks for building traditional machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python. The notebooks include relevant theory, useful examples, and performance comparison with the sklearn algorithms. Some of the algorithms are quite complex, especially SVM, so some of the deeper theory and functionality is skipped. 

Notebooks:
- K-nearest neighbours
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- SVM

## Sources 

I used a handful of sources for compiling this list. In each notebook, I include the specific sources, but in general the most useful resources for me were as follows:
- [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) by Jason Brownlee - This site includes many ML implementations from scratch with detailed descriptions. In many cases, the code in my notebooks directly copies the code from this site.
- [StatQuest](https://statquest.org/ with Josh Starmer - Josh makes very fun and approachable videos for understanding statistics and machine learning concepts
- AI: A modern Approach by Norvig and Russell - A standard AI textbook
- Machine Learning by Peter Flach - More in-depth discussion of ML algorithms
- [Udemy Course by Jose Portilla (Pierian Data)](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp)
- [Udemy Course by Ligency](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning)

## To do:

- Create more notebook tutorials: Random Forests, Perceptrons
- Discuss strengths and weaknesses of each approach
- Tutorial on data preparation, data cleaning, and feature engineering
- Tutorial on performance metrics
- Example case study with an interesting dataset
